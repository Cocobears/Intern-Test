# Intern-Test

Hello and Welcome to the source code,

"login.html" is the first page in this front end app. After the user has been succesfully authenticated, he will be redirected to "main.html".

The following log-in details will grant you entry: 	

Username: demo		
Password: demo1234

As requested, the front end app uses HTML5, CSS3 and JQuery code and is adaptive to different screen sizes.

For any additional clarification, feel free to email me.

Thank you for your consideration,
Nathan
